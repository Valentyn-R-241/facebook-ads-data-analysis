# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 — Small Analysis

This is a short data analysis project based on the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

The goal was to practice working with a real dataset in Python, using:

- pandas for data cleaning and transformation  
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook for documenting the process

Nothing fancy — just basic exploration: who the developers are, what they use, and a few charts about it.

Feel free to open the notebook and take a look
